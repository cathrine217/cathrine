        <!-- History of Baking -->
        <p style="color: blanchedalmond;">
            Baking has origins in ancient cultures,
            making it one of the oldest culinary disciplines in human history.
            Around 6000 BCE, baking was first documented in ancient Egypt,
            where it is thought that the Egyptians learned about fermentation
            and were able to make leavened bread (Toussaint-Samat, 2009).
            Bread quickly became a staple dish after they started baking it in clay ovens.
            Ancient Greece and Rome adopted the baking tradition, and bakers there were regarded as professionals. 
            The first baker's guild was established in Rome by 168 BCE, 
            demonstrating the increasing significance of baking in society (Jacob, 2003). 
            Fruit and nut-filled pastries were brought by the Romans,
            and some affluent homes even hired special bakers.
            Baking became popular throughout medieval Europe townspeople were able 
            to bake their wares thanks to shared ovens, making baking more accessible.
            However, bakeries started to operate as commercial enterprises
            in the 17th and 18th centuries. Baking equipment greatly improved throughout
            the Industrial Revolution, and mass manufacturing was made possible by 
            the development of mechanical ovens and mixers (Wilson, 2010).
            Although the advent of supermarkets and packaged goods altered the
            baking industry's environment in the 20th century, small-scale and
            artisan bakeries have continued to enjoy popularity due to their fresh, 
            handmade items that prioritize quality and tradition.
            Today's bakeries continue a long tradition of using baked goods
            to serve communities and celebrate culture by fusing traditional methods with
            cutting-edge technology.
